## About
This Covid tracker provides almost every counrty covid data and return information like Active cases count, Confirmed cases count, Recovered cases count, Death cases count, Total Test count.<br>
I have used pie chart library which also shows data graphically with different colors. It has very simple UI and I have also implemented simple search bar to search a particular country.<br>
This is the first app i made for learning API fetch from public API with the help of Retrofit Networking library. I have learnt the concept like HTTP GET & HTTP POST request.I used to convert JAVA object in JSON representation and convert back JSON to JAVA objects.<br>
